LESSONS LEARNED
===============

1. Hash Function Selection: Different projects choose different hash functions
   based on their specific requirements (security, speed, distribution quality)

2. Concurrency Patterns: Each project handles concurrent access differently:
   - Single-threaded (Redis)
   - Lock-free (Caffeine)
   - Lock-based concurrent collections (Kafka)
   - Utility-focused thread safety (Guava)

3. Memory Management: Production systems require careful attention to:
   - Dynamic resizing strategies
   - Memory overhead minimization
   - Garbage collection impact
   - Cache eviction policies

4. Real-world Considerations:
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Configuration flexibility
   - Integration with existing systems
   - Performance tuning capabilities

5. Domain-Specific Optimizations:
